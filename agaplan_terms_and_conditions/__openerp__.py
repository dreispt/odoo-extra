    Module that allows you to add custom pdf files to any report (e.g. Terms and Conditions)
    

==================================
WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH IT?
==================================
Add one or more pdf documents to any OpenERP report!

    - Automatically have such attachment(s) included in your report.
    - Specify where you want the attachment(s) to be included in the report
        - Before the report
        - After the report
        - Every other page (e.g. for duplex printing)
    - Define your own conditions as to when the attachment should be included in the report 
    (e.g. only when checkbox Print Terms has been set to true for a partner)
    
Example: automatically attach your General Terms and Conditions to your Sales Invoices so that they are automatically printed for each invoice.

==================================
WHAT IS CHANGED IN OPENERP?
==================================
The field Print Terms has been added to the Sales & Purchases tab of the Partner form. You can include this field in the attachment conditions.
The Administration --> Company menu has two new menu items:
- Terms
- Term Rules

==================================
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO TO GET IT TO WORK?
==================================

In the Administration --> Companies menu, create at least one Term and Term Rule.

- Terms: to enter the name of your attachment, add the pdf file and select the Insertion mode (where the document should be included)

- Term Rules: to define for a specific Term the link from your pdf file to an OpenERP report, e.g. Invoices (account.invoice).
  Add your conditions to determine when the attachment should be added to the report. If no condition specified, the attachment will
  always be included in the selected report.
